      <p class="leftText">For my final project in AP Computer Science A, I worked with a few <br>classmates to code a game called Island Adventures! There are 4 maps: jungle,</br> beach, tundra, and lava. The goal of the game is to accumulate upgrades, boosts, <br>and currency in order to increase player stats and defeat the bosses of each new island. </br> This is achieved when the player adequately interacts with its surroundings <br> and wins mini-games, passes obstacles, collects currency, opens chests, and more. <br>With each successful action, the player receives either a boost or some amount <br>of coins, which are then used in the shop catalog to upgrade weapons and amenities.<br> At the end of the last island, a final boss (my teacher) is presented and <br>the game is only completed after its defeat. Java GUI was used to build the game.</p>

  <p class="rightText">I'm a volunteer intern at a local nonprofit Wings for Success <br> which gives women a fresh start in their lives by giving them free clothes <br> and job advice! As part of the internship, I coded an app using Swift <br> for them that accompanies their website. It has many <br> features such as fashion tips and job advice. It also allows users <br>to book appointments,1:1 sessions, donate, and sign up to be a volunteer! <br> The app was launched on the App Store in January of 2023!</p>

  <p class="leftText">I co-founded a nonprofit, Code Her World with my friend! As an organization, <br> we provide FREE virtual programming classes to girls and nonbinaries from the <br> age of 11-18. We've hosted various camps and workshops for all sorts <br> of computer science skills like Web Development and app design. <br> We've also launched a 1:1 mentorship program where students have the <br> opportunity to receive personalized instruction in computer science. Whether it's <br> homework help or learning the basics of a new language, we've got them covered! <br> We have taught over 50 students and have reached over 100 students across <br> 7 countries! With 15 people on our team, we have been widening our impact and <br> hosting more programs. Our website was programmed by the other co-founder and <br> I using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

  <p class="rightText">Through the Inspirit AI program, I worked with a group of <br> other students to develop an artificial intelligence model that detects objects for <br> self-driving cars. Images were first trained to be classified as either a truck, car, or <br>person. We used 3 different techniques to train the images: perceptrons and sliding <br> windows, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, and YOLO v3. <br>Yolo generated the highest accuracy. The program was 10 weeks long <br> and each week, we explored various aspects of AI and the math <br> behind it (linear regression and k-nearest neighbors).</p>

  <p class="leftText">Impactive was an app created for the Congressional App Challenge. <br>The purpose of the app is to help small businesses and nonprofits design <br> apps for their organizations without having to spend thousands of dollars on <br> hiring a professional. They would be able to design as well as learn <br>how to develop their own app through free tutorials to help them get started. <br> We used the Swift programming language and the XCode IDE to build it.<br>With this app, my partner and I placed 3rd in our congressional district!</p>

  <p class="rightText">During my Kode with Klossy camp in app development, there was an optional <br>app challenge to design an app for the famous cosmetics brand, Estee Lauder. <br> I decided to enter and produced the an app that highlights their products, <br> offers, and their most recent (at the time) product line launched, Advanced <br> Night Repair. I used the Swift programming language to code it.</p>

class="leftPic" src="menstruation.jpeg"></a>

  <p class="leftText">At the annual TecHacks Hackathon, my group and I won the Activism Track <br> for developing a website called Menstruation Station. The website is a <br> "mock" nonprofit organization that provides underserved women and girls <br> with free menstrual products. As a way to obtain more products than the usual,<br> they can complete community service hours. Additionally, through <br>the website other people can educate themselves on the issue, donate <br>a certain amount towards the cause, or initiate their own chapter locally. As <br> a challenge, we added a login/signup screen. That portion took a <br>while to complete because it was a brand new topic to us. We used HTML, CSS, <br>and JavaScript to develop the website.</p>
