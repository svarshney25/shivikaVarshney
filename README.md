I developed a personal website using HTML and CSS to showcase my background, experiences, and projects, serving as a central place for 
people to learn more about me and the projects I've worked on. The website includes an About Me page with my personal story and interests,
a page about Code Her World detailing the nonprofit I co-founded, its mission, accomplishments, and animated statistics, 
and a Projects page highlighting my personal coding projects. I focused on creating a clean design, clear navigation, and some interactive features like animated counters 
to make the site engaging and informative. I spent approximately 15 hours planning, coding, and designing the website, including both the HTML/CSS structure
and the visual styling to make it aesthetically appealing and functional.
